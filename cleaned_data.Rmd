# After trying to figure out how to get rid of all the needless data in r I resolved that since I am gonna have to read through it all manually, it would be fine to do it in excel, so I used this link to export it! https://datatofish.com/export-dataframe-to-csv-in-r/ . I then went through the data and deleted all that was not needed for my project. This will have to change based upon your filepath!
